                                Tokenization describes the process of transforming traditional equity holdings into digital shares. These blockchain based digital "tokens" allow investors to view detailed information about their holdings, and make it possible to buy, sell, and transfer private assets online.

                                Cost of tokenization varies based on asset size and requirements. Tokenization is a small cost compared to the fees associated with a typical capital raise or real estate transaction. As such, tokenization is designed to be a very small addition to your asset's total cost of ownership.
