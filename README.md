## Brief Description
BitEstate is an online platform that offers tokenized real estate investment opportunites to its customers.
Operators who have put up their properties for sell after a vetting process as well as the required legal documents that show proof of ownership have been submitted will get their tokenized properties listed on the platform where a diverse group of investors (not limited by geographical location, social standing, net-worth or other constraints) are able to view and buy these assets.
This entire process is aided by the use of smart contracts which enable custom business logic to be coded depending on investor needs. The contracts enable the sell and resell of tokens as well as increase the speed of creating, issuing, and exchanging assets.
